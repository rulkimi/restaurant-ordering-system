# Restaurant Order System

Welcome to the Restaurant Order System repository! This is a simple command-line-based restaurant ordering system implemented in C. It allows customers to place orders for various food items, drinks, desserts, and set meals. The system also offers a member login feature, bill generation, and payment processing. Additionally, there's an admin mode for viewing gross profits.

## Features

1. **User Modes:** Choose between the following options:
   - **Current User Mode:** Users need to log in with the provided username and password. If the login details are correct, they can place orders as members.
   - **Guest Mode:** Non-members can place orders without logging in, similar to members but without discounts.
   - **Gross Profit (Admins Only):** Admins can check the total profit for the day by logging in with admin credentials.

2. **Member Login:** Members can log in to access special features and discounts. If wrong login details are provided, users are prompted back to the main menu.

3. **Member Discounts:** Members receive discounts based on their order total: 5% for totals > RM100, 10% for totals >= RM200, and 15% for totals >= RM300.

4. **Bill Generation:** Detailed bills are generated with itemized pricing.

5. **Payment Processing:** Calculate the total price and process payments, providing change value.

6. **Admin Mode:** Admins can access gross profit information for the day.

7. **User-Friendly Menu Storage:** The menu items are stored efficiently using arrays for easy management and expansion.
